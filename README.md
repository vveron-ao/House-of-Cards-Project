# House-of-Cards-Project
The House of Cards Project aimed to test students' understanding of the engineering design process. Veronica led her team to successfully achieve full points on the project through the engineering design process. The project consisted of a project plan, index card tower, CAD design, and a Python program. The repository comprises the Python program. The Python component compares past teams' data with Veronica's team to output scatter plot graphs and an isometric tower view turtle design.
