# House-of-Cards-Project
The House of Cards Project aimed to test students' understanding of the engineering design process. Veronica led her team to successfully achieve full points on the project through the engineering design process. The project consisted of a project plan, index card tower, CAD design, and a Python program. This is the Python component of the House of Cards final semester project. It compares past teams' data with her team's data to output scatter plot graphs. It also includes a turtle drawing of the isometric view of the index card tower.
